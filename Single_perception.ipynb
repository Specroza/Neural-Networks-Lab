        "The dataset was created manually using two input features: study hours per day and attendance percentage. A total of ten data points were used. The labels were assigned based on a predefined rule where a student is classified as Pass if the study hours are greater than or equal to four and the attendance percentage is greater than or equal to sixty-five. Otherwise, the student is classified as Fail. This rule was chosen to realistically represent student performance.\n",

        "\n",
        "3. Model Learning Verification\n",
        "The learning of the model was verified by training the perceptron for several epochs and observing the reduction in errors. As the number of epochs increased, the number of misclassifications decreased, indicating that the model was learning effectively. After training, the accuracy of the model was calculated by comparing the predicted outputs with the actual labels. The final accuracy achieved was approximately 80 percent, which confirms successful learning."
